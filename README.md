### Description

a new version of spot... he moves around in a little meadow. he moves around the grass nole. its alot better than the earlier version and plus you can make him happy by giving him presents or playing with him. i hope you like it an please vote!

[fix 1] i fixed the bug that didnt save the happiness meter and load it again

[update 1] i made it so that spot minimizes in the sys tray so you dont have to exit the program, plus i made the main form moveable so you can place it in different places
